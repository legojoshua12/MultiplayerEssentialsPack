			<Text>A sala is an open pavilion, used as a meeting place and to protect people from sun and rain. Most are open on all four sides. They are found throughout Thailand in Buddhist temple areas, or Wats, although they can also be located in other places. A person who builds a sala at a temple or in a public place gains religious merit. Some temples have large salas where laity can hear sermons or receive religious instructions.  In rural areas, travelers can use them to rest and reflect.</Text>

			<Text>The Sala is a Siamese unique building that increases the speed at which [ICON_GREAT_PEOPLE] Great people are generated by 25%. Unlike the Garden it replaces, it is available upon the discovery of Construction, requires no maintenance, and the city doesn't need to be next to a river for the Sala to be constructed.</Text>
