			<Text>The Teutonic Order was a German medieval military order devoted to the protection of Christian pilgrims making their way to the Holy Land. Because many of its members had served in the Crusades, they were known as Teutonic Knights. The military membership was always small, with volunteers and mercenaries augmenting the force as needed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Livonian Brothers of the Sword were absorbed by the Teutonic Knights in 1237, after the former had suffered a devastating defeat in the Battle of Saule. The Livonian branch subsequently became known as the Livonian Order.</Text>
