			<Text>Canals are man-made channels for water, also known as waterways if they're navigable transportation canals used for carrying ships and boats shipping goods and conveying people, like those connected in a city network. The city of Venice was built in the early 1500's A.D. on a collection of 117 low islands at the center of a lagoon. The numerous canals provided an ideal location for a city because they formed a natural defense against foreign attackers, similar to a moat. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Canals are so deeply identified with Venice that many canal cities have been nicknamed "the Venice ofâ€¦". The city is built on marshy islands, with wooden piles supporting the buildings, so that the land is man-made rather than the waterways.</Text>
