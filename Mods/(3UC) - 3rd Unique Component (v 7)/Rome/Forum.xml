			<Text>The Forum is a Roman unique building that increases the amount of [ICON_GOLD] Gold a city generates. Trade routes other players make to a city with a Forum will generate an extra 1 [ICON_GOLD] Gold for the city owner and the trade route owner gains an additional 1 [ICON_GOLD] Gold for the trade route. Unlike the Market it replaces, the Forum also increases a city's [ICON_GREAT_PEOPLE] Great Person generation by 10%.</Text>

			<Text>Roman civic and commercial life was largely centered upon the "forum," an open space surrounded by markets, temples, government buildings, and the "rostra," a platform where Romans made political speeches to their fellows. The Roman forums may have been modeled upon the "agoras," which served much the same purposes in earlier Greek cities. The most famous forum is the "Roman Forum," located at the center of the Imperial City, but most other Roman cities had them as well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Roman Forum contained a number of very important and beautiful buildings, including temples devoted to Romulus, Saturn and Vesta, several basilicas, and the "Curia Hostilia," which housed the Roman Senate.</Text>
