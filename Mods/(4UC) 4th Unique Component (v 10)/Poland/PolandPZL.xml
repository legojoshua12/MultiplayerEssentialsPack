			<Text>The PZL.23 Karas ("Crucian"), was a Polish light bomber, designed in 1934 and introduced into the Polish Air Force in 1936. It was a full-metal monoplane. It took three crewmembers, could carry up to 700kg of bombs, and sported two machine guns for self-defence. Despite initial engine problems, the design became popular and was met with interest in the Romanian and Bulgarian Air Forces. Altohugh outnumbered in the German invasion of Poland in 1939 and obsolete in comparison to superior German designs, the PZL.23 aircraft carried out succesful attacks on German armoured columns. After the war, it became a symbol of pre-war Polish Air Force, and miniature modellers' favourite. </Text>
