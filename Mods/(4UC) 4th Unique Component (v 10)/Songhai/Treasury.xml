				Safe economic trade existed throughout the Songhai Empire, due to the 200,000 person army stationed in the provinces. The Julla, or merchants, would form partnerships which the state protected, which had the effect of protecting the port cities on Niger. In addition, the government was centralized by creating a large and elaborate bureaucracy to oversee the empire's interests. Weights, measures, and currency were standardized so that culture throughout the Songhai began to homogenize.
