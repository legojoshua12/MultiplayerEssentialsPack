			<Text>The Great Spy can conduct espionage missions in foreign territory. This versatile ability allows you to sabotage rival civilizations, destroy resources, and even steal great works. Espionage missions vary in strength (with the strongest requiring an additional [ICON_SPY_GLASS] Intelligence cost). However, many also carry a small chance for the Great Spy to survive and be reused for a new mission. Great Spies also make excellent scouts with passive bonuses to movement, sight, and the ability to enter rival territory. Additionally, as long as the Great Spy is on a tile owned by another civilization, you will be able to see that civilization's current [ICON_CULTURE] Culture level and [ICON_RESEARCH] Research project.</Text>

			<Text>Establishments for the dispensation and consumption of alcoholic beverages have been a fixture of cities throughout human civilization. The Babylonian Code of Hammurabi suggests the death penalty for proprietors diluting beer, while the ancient Greek 'lesche' and 'phatnai' catered to the needs of foreign traders and envoys. The traditional English tavern has its roots in the Roman period and, although still considered a place of ill-repute, the taberna was understood as a higher class establishment than the similar caupona which served slaves and the lower classes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tabernae eventually evolved into alehouses run by women and finally the medieval English inn; sanctuaries for wayfaring strangers, thieves, and political malcontents. By the middle of the 16th century the dining-out habit was well established among townsmen of all classes, and the tavern originated the custom of providing a daily meal at a fixed time. As taverns gradually became more socially acceptable, some of the better houses became regular meeting halls and unofficial clubhouses providing companionship to the masses.</Text>

			<Text>'The Motherland Calls' is an enormous statue located near the city of Volograd, Russia which commemorates the sacrifices of Soviet soldiers in the Battle of Stalingrad; 1942-1943. The monument was inspired by the ancient Greek sculpture the 'Winged Victory of Samothrace' and was designed by sculptor Yevgeny Vuchetich and structural engineer Nikolai Nikitin. Measuring 85 metres from the tip of its sword to the top of the plinth, it was declared the largest statue in the world in 1967. Today, it is the second tallest statue of a woman in the world.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The monument is highly complex from an engineering point of view, due to its characteristic posture with a sword raised high in the right hand and the left hand extended in a calling gesture. The technology behind the hollow statue is based on a combination of pre-stressed concrete with wire ropes structure. However, 'The Motherland Calls' is not fixed to its foundations and is held in place only by its weight, and there is concern that the statue will lean due to changes in groundwater level causing movement of its foundation.</Text>
