			<Text>Diplomatic Units are essential to the trade, foreign relations and global influence of any great empire. From the emissaries of warlord kings in the Classical Era to the professionally-trained Ambassadors of the Information Age, direct your influence to city-states over the millennia to control global resources and politics. Diplomatic units can be a major boon to your Influence over city-states, but beware, as wars have been fought over far more petty things than the control of a city-state.</Text>

The base amount of Infuence gained from a Diplomatic Mission increases as a player unlocks new promotions for Diplomatic Units through new unit types, wonders and buildings. [ENDLINE][ENDLINE]Players may only have a limited number of Diplomatic Units active at any given time. The maximum number of active Diplomatic Units increases with each new Diplomatic Unit type unlocked via the Tech Tree. </Text>
