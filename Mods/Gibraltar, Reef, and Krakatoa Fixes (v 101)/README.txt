-- MOD: * Prevents Gibraltar from spawning on small islands; especially single-tile ones which may render it unworkable! (special thanks to whoward69 for help)
--		* Prevents Gibraltar from spawning next to ice, which I believe looks really bad.
--		* Adds a land check for the Reef so it doesn't spawn too far out into the sea and become unworkable.
--  	* Adds a requirement that the core tiles of the Reef must initially be water as well so that resources aren't wasted around it and out in the sea.
--		* Adds an ice check for the upper adjacent plots of the Reef so its upper half doesn't become adjacent to ice.
--		* Adds a latitude check for all water-based natural wonders in this function.  Unlike land-based NW's, these are too flexible and need more restrictions.
--		  (With the new latitude check keeping them away from the polar areas, the ice checks aren't really needed anymore, but I kept them in for modders.)
--		* Adds Krakatoa as a custom method so its conditions can be controlled better.  It now only spawns near islands and smaller landmasses.
